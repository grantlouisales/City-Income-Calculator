# State Cost Index Calculator

## Why this project
This state cost index calculator was made to teach me about cloud databases. I wanted to learn more about databases so that I can widen my horizons and learn a new skill to make me a better software engineer.

## Description
This project will allow someone to add users, remove users, find the difference of cost index between 2 states, and take users income and set it as a median to see how much money is needed for other states. This program integrates state info and user info with firebase. It allows the program to receive data on state information and user information.

# Cloud Database
The cloud database I decided to use was google firebase. I created 2 collections inside of the database. The first collection is used for containing users and their information. The second collection is used for states and their information.

# Development Enviorment
Some tools that I used to complete this project was VSCode, the Python language, and the Google Firebase libraries.
